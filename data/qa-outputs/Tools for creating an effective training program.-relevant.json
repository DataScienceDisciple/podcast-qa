{"953": {"answer": "The context provides information about tools that can impact physical performance and skill learning. One of the tools mentioned is related to breathing, specifically nasal breathing and breath holds. This tool has been shown to have beneficial effects on physical and cognitive performance. Therefore, a highly actionable and easy to understand answer to the question \"Tools for creating an effective training program\" would be to incorporate nasal breathing and breath holds as part of the training program.", "URL": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaE9XyMMAHY&t=511s", "keywords": "['physical performance', 'skill learning', 'foundational variables', 'exercise', 'food', 'supplements', 'breathing techniques', 'mindset tools', 'visualization tools', 'machines', 'devices', 'nasal breathing', 'breath holds', 'energy', 'stress reduction', 'performance optimization', 'cognitive performance']"}, "1304": {"answer": "The context provides information about designing training programs and setting goals. It mentions the importance of assessing properly, setting specific and realistic goals, and aligning the goals with the individual's limitations. It also mentions the SMART system for goal setting. \n\nBased on this information, some tools for creating an effective training program could include:\n- Assessing tools or methods to properly evaluate the individual's current fitness level and identify specific training goals.\n- Goal-setting tools or frameworks, such as the SMART system, to help set specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and timely goals.\n- Planning tools or templates to create a structured and progressive training program that aligns with the individual's limitations and goals.\n\nThese tools can help ensure that the training program is effective and tailored to the individual's needs and objectives.", "URL": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIy-WQCZd4M&t=593s", "keywords": "['fitness program', 'adherence', 'progressive overload', 'plan', 'realistic', 'limitations', 'Andy Galpin', 'training programs', 'assess', 'training goal', 'SMART system', 'specific', 'measurable', 'attainable', 'realistic', 'timely', 'aligned', 'performance anchor', 'fitness testing protocol', 'dopamine system', 'motivation', 'goal attainment']"}, "144": {"answer": "Relevant answer: \"To create an effective training program, you can consider incorporating mental training and visualization practices. These practices involve brief epochs and repeats of specific sequences of motor and cognitive behavior. The sequences should be relatively simple so that anyone can imagine them. Repeating mental training and visualization over time improves metaplasticity and can lead to improvements in real-world performance. It is also important to create many parallels between real-world training and mental training. Additionally, a combination of physical and mental training is considered best for learning a new skill.\"", "URL": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RYyQRQFgFk&t=6778s", "keywords": "['mental training', 'visualization', 'cognitive behavior', 'metaplasticity', 'real-world training', 'skill development', 'neural connections', 'real-world performance']"}}
