"1. The podcast covered mechanisms for generating movement and designing protocols for optimizing skill learning.\n2. Motor skills and physical skills have some overlap with neuroplasticity for learning other types of skills.\n3. The ultradian cycle is a 90-minute cycle optimal for learning and attention in sleep and wakefulness.\n4. The ultradian cycle may not be a good constraint for skill learning in most cases.\n5. 10 minutes of maximum focus skill learning work is beneficial, whereas 2 hours of haphazard work is not.\n6. Density of training inside a session is key for skill learning, with maximal or near-maximal density of repetitions and failures.\n7. Don't let arbitrary constraints prevent engagement in practice.\n8. Improvement in skill may be stutter-started and not always linear, but there will be incredible improvement over time.\n9. Physical practices may not need to be 90 minutes long, as it depends on the activity.\n10. The podcast provides valuable information on optimizing skill learning and movement generation."
