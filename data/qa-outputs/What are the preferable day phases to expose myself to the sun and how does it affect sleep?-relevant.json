        "answer": "The preferable day phases to expose yourself to the sun are early in the day, preferably in the morning. Getting sunlight or other forms of bright light in the eyes early in the day is important for circadian rhythm alignment and reset. Exposure to natural daylight at work can also improve sleep quality and efficiency. It is recommended to get at least 30-40 minutes of exposure to natural daylight, as outdoor light is usually more potent than indoor lighting. Spending less time with sunglasses can help with sunlight stimulation of the eyes.",

        "answer": "The preferable day phases to expose yourself to the sun are early in the morning and around sunset. This is because bright light early in the day and at sunset helps set and anchor the central circadian clock. Viewing sunlight around sunset can also prevent negative effects on melatonin release later at night. Exposing yourself to sunlight at these particular times of day is important because every cell in the body needs light information. It's crucial to get light information to all cells and organs by viewing sunlight with your eyes at the correct times of day.",

        "answer": "The preferable day phases to expose yourself to the sun are early in the morning. Getting sunlight in your eyes first thing in the morning is vital for mental and physical health. This helps set in motion biological cascades within every cell and organ of the body, promoting metabolic well-being, positive hormone functioning, and mental health. It is recommended to spend a minimum of 2 minutes, ideally 10-30 minutes, outdoors without sunglasses. This exposure to sunlight helps regulate the body's circadian rhythms and promotes wakefulness. However, it is important to avoid staring directly at the sun or any light that is too bright to prevent retinal damage.",
