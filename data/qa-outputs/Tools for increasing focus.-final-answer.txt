To increase focus, there are several actionable tools and strategies you can implement:

1. Visual Focus: Practice visually focusing on one location for 30 seconds to three minutes. This enhances overt visual focus and attention, which in turn enhances cognitive focus. Refocusing is also important for training the brain to focus better.

2. Warm-up: Understand that focus requires a warm-up. Start with simple tasks and gradually move on to more complex ones to ease into a focused state.

3. Boost Neurochemicals: Increase neurochemicals like epinephrine, adrenaline, acetylcholine, and dopamine. You can do this through activities like exercise, proper nutrition, and staying hydrated.

4. Gradual Progression: Focus is a dynamic process that involves gradually dropping into shallow focus and progressing to deeper levels of focus. Start with easier tasks and gradually move on to more challenging ones.

5. Release Pressure: Avoid putting too much pressure on yourself to feel focused all the time. Accept that focus fluctuates and it's normal to have moments of distraction.

6. Neuroplasticity: Improve focus through neuroplasticity by engaging the neural circuits responsible for focus repeatedly over time. Practice focusing on tasks for extended periods and gradually increase the duration.

7. Optimize Sleep: Prioritize quality sleep as it plays a crucial role in improving focus. Establish a consistent sleep routine, create a conducive sleep environment, and ensure you get enough restorative sleep.

8. Auditory Tools: Consider using auditory sound-based tools like 40 Hz binaural beats and white, pink, or brown noise. These can help create a focused and calming environment.

9. Connect Emotionally: Connect tasks to your personal values and goals to increase motivation and engagement. Repeating what is emotionally important to you can trigger neuroplasticity and enhance focus.

10. Be Patient and Consistent: Remember that focus is not a step function but a dynamic process. Be patient with yourself and practice these strategies consistently over time to improve your ability to focus.

By implementing these tools and strategies, you can optimize your focus and concentration for improved performance and productivity.
