The preferable day phase to expose yourself to the sun is early in the morning. Getting sunlight or other forms of bright light in the eyes early in the day is important for circadian rhythm alignment and reset. It is recommended to spend at least 30-40 minutes outdoors without sunglasses to get the full benefits of natural daylight. This exposure to sunlight helps regulate the body's circadian rhythms, promote wakefulness, and improve sleep quality and efficiency.

Here are some actionable tips to optimize your sun exposure:

1. Wake up and go outside for at least 30 minutes in the morning without sunglasses.
2. Take a walk or do some light exercise outdoors during this time.
3. If you work indoors, try to incorporate natural daylight into your workspace by opening blinds or sitting near a window.
4. Avoid staring directly at the sun or any light that is too bright to prevent retinal damage.
5. If possible, try to view sunlight around sunset as well, as it helps set and anchor the central circadian clock.
6. Limit the use of sunglasses during the day to allow sunlight stimulation of the eyes.
7. Remember that outdoor light is usually more potent than indoor lighting, so try to spend more time outside when possible.
8. Consider using a light therapy device if you are unable to get enough natural sunlight during the day.
9. Be consistent with your sun exposure routine to maintain the benefits on your sleep and overall health.
10. Consult with a healthcare professional if you have any concerns or specific health conditions that may affect your sun exposure.

By following these tips, you can optimize your sun exposure and improve your sleep quality, energy levels, and overall well-being.
