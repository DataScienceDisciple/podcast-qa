{"1741": {"answer": "To sleep well, it is important to maintain consistency in your sleep and wake times. Avoid sleeping in longer than an hour beyond your normal wake-up time. If you need to take a nap, it is better to do so in the afternoon rather than sleeping in too long. If you stay up late, wait 90 to 120 minutes after waking up before consuming caffeine, as caffeine can disrupt your sleep. Try to keep your sleep-wake times relatively constant, with a difference of plus or minus an hour. On days when you feel you haven't gotten enough sleep, delay your caffeine intake. Additionally, you can use deep relaxation methods like NSDR or the Reveri app to compensate for lack of sleep. However, it's important to note that there is no complete compensation for lack of sleep. These recommendations are supported by science.", "URL": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2aWYjSA1Jc&t=5300s", "keywords": "['sleep', 'circadian rhythm', 'naps', 'caffeine', 'compensatory sleep', 'relaxation', 'lack of sleep', 'science']"}, "2774": {"answer": "To sleep well, here are some tips based on the provided context:\n\n1.
